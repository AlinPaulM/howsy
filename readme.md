Howsy - simple PHP MVC OOP project from scratch
------------------------------------------------

SETUP
-i used Wampserver64 (with PHP 8.0.12)
-git clone the project to C:\wamp64\www\projects
-composer install
-import db.sql
-Login with:
username: user1
password: password1

username: user2
password: password2


NOTE
This is just a simple project from scratch. Don't have production expectations from it when you read the code, there's things i did quickly to save time implementing this (e.g. i stored the password as md5, not recommended in production, use sth like https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.password.php)
